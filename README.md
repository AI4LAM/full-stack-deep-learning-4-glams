# Full Stack Deep Learning (for GLAMS)
> A study group for the Full Stack Deep Learning Course with a focus on using AI in GLAM settings 

## What?
A study group of the upcoming [Full Stack Deep Learning course](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) with the aim of focusing on the application/context of AI in a GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) setting. 


## tl;dr
a study group:
- following the ‘Full Stack Deep Learning’ course with a focus on applications in GLAM settings
- focused on helping each other out
- tackling domain-specific issues
- has a practical focus

## The Full Stack Deep Learning course
This group will follow the upcoming (2021) version of the Full Stack Deep Learning course). Signup link: https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/

### What the course covers:
As the name implies this course focuses on the broader aspects of using deep learning in a practical setting. 
- ♺ Setting up an ML Project and ML Lifecycle
- 🛠 Infrastructure and tooling 
- 📖 Data management 
- 👩‍👩‍👦ML teams
- 🏋 Training and debugging 
- 🧪 Testing and deployment 

### Why you might want to do the course?
There is a lot of interest in applying AI/ machine learning in GLAM settings with a range of potential applications being explored. A previous [study group](https://github.com/AI4LAM/fastai4GLAMS) followed the fastai course with a focus on a GLAM setting.

Whilst creating and training models is an important part of using deep learning/machine learning there are lots of steps before after and during this which are also important. Some of these additional considerations are technical but many contain social components too. 
We also hope that following this course with others working in the GLAM setting will useful will be useful since we will have many of the same challenges (IT infrastructure, $$$ etc.)  and opportunities (open and interesting data, IIIF etc.) which may also be different from a business deployment of ML. 


### Pre-requisites 
Some components of the course assume some previous knowledge of ML/Deep learning but the study group is open to anyone with an interest in the course and a GLAM setting. 


## Practicalities 
We'll meet every two weeks and will use the [fastai4glams](https://forums.fast.ai/) forum thread to allow for asynchronous discussion. 

The start date of the study group is TBC but will likely be in March. If you want to get an email reminder before it starts signup [here](https://forms.gle/3GTgW5Th15ua5wjd7)
